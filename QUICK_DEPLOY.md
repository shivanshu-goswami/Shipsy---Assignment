# Quick Deployment Steps

## Answer: NOT READY YET ‚ö†Ô∏è

You need to complete a few critical steps before deployment.

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Do These First

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
cd c:\Users\kumar_kfd5e47\OneDrive\Desktop\ShipsyTask\expensify
npx prisma migrate deploy
```
**Why:** Your code expects `payment_status` field but database has `is_reimbursed`

### Step 2: Commit to Git
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete expense tracking app with payment status and modern UI"
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/expensify.git
git push -u origin main
```

## üîß Vercel Setup

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repo
4. Add Environment Variables (CRITICAL):
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-url-with-pgbouncer
   DIRECT_URL=your-postgres-direct-url
   JWT_SECRET=generate-a-strong-secret-min-32-chars
   ```
5. Click Deploy

### Generate JWT_SECRET:
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::GetBytes(64))
```
