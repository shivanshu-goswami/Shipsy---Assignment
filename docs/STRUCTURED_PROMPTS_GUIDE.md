1. Technology stack (frontend, backend, database)
2. Project structure and folder organization
3. Authentication strategy
4. Database schema approach
5. API design patterns

Focus on scalability, security, and developer experience.
```

### **Changes Produced**:
- âœ… **Tech Stack Decision**: Next.js 15 with App Router, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
- âœ… **Architecture Pattern**: API routes with middleware for authentication
- âœ… **Database Strategy**: Enum-based categories, payment status tracking
- âœ… **Security Approach**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Modular organization with separate API routes

### **Why This Prompt Worked**:
The prompt was comprehensive and focused on production requirements. Gemini provided specific technology recommendations with reasoning, helping me avoid common pitfalls in full-stack architecture.

## ðŸ“‹ **Prompt 2: Database Schema Design**

### **Context & Challenge**:
I needed to design a robust database schema that could handle user management, expense tracking, and future scalability. Traditional boolean fields for payment status seemed limiting.

### **Prompt Used**:
```
Create a comprehensive Prisma database schema for an expense tracking application with these requirements:

User Management:
- Unique email-based authentication
- Secure password storage
- User isolation for expenses

Expense Management:
- Description, base amount, tax rate
- Categories: Food, Travel, Office, Other
- Payment status beyond simple paid/unpaid
- Automatic total calculation capability
- Created/updated timestamps
- Proper relationships and constraints

Design considerations:
- Use enums for consistency
- Include proper indexing for performance
- Plan for future payment methods
- Ensure data integrity with foreign keys
- Consider audit trail capabilities

Provide the complete schema.prisma file with detailed comments.
```

### **Changes Produced**:
- âœ… **Enhanced Payment Status**: Replaced boolean with enum (Paid, Pending, Reimbursable, Recurring)
- âœ… **Proper Indexing**: Added indexes for userId, category, and createdAt for performance
- âœ… **Data Integrity**: Cascade deletes and proper foreign key constraints
- âœ… **Future-Proofing**: Extensible enum structure for new categories
- âœ… **Audit Fields**: createdAt and updatedAt timestamps

### **Why This Prompt Worked**:
The prompt specified both functional requirements and performance considerations. Gemini provided a schema that went beyond basic needs to include production concerns like indexing and data integrity.

## ðŸ“‹ **Prompt 3: Authentication System Development**

### **Context & Challenge**:
I needed secure authentication with proper password hashing, JWT token management, and error handling. Security was crucial, so I wanted AI guidance on best practices.

### **Prompt Used**:
```
Build a secure authentication system for a Next.js application with these specifications:

Security Requirements:
- Bcrypt password hashing with optimal salt rounds
- JWT token generation with proper expiration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common attacks (injection, brute force)
- Proper error messages without information leakage

API Endpoints Needed:
1. User registration (/api/auth/register)
2. User login (/api/auth/login)
3. JWT token verification helper function

Implementation Details:
- Use Next.js 15 App Router API routes
- Integrate with Prisma for database operations
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Validate email format and password strength
- Return consistent JSON responses
- Handle edge cases (duplicate users, invalid credentials)

Provide complete API route implementations with security best practices.
```

### **Changes Produced**:
- âœ… **Enhanced Security**: Increased bcrypt salt rounds to 12 for better security
- âœ… **Input Validation**: Email format validation and password strength requirements
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses without security information leakage
- âœ… **Token Strategy**: 7-day JWT expiration with secure payload structure
- âœ… **Edge Case Handling**: Duplicate user detection and proper status codes

### **Why This Prompt Worked**:
The prompt emphasized security requirements upfront and asked for production-ready implementations. Gemini provided code that included security best practices I might have missed manually.

## ðŸ“‹ **Prompt 4: Advanced API Development**

### **Context & Challenge**:
I needed to create comprehensive expense management APIs with advanced features like filtering, pagination, and search. The challenge was balancing functionality with performance and security.

### **Prompt Used**:
```
Develop a comprehensive expense management API system with advanced features:

Core CRUD Operations:
- Create new expenses with validation
- List expenses with advanced filtering
- Update existing expenses with ownership verification
- Delete expenses with proper authorization

Advanced Features Required:
- Pagination (page, limit parameters)
- Multi-field filtering (category, payment_status, date range)
- Search functionality (description search, case-insensitive)
- Sorting options (date, amount, description, category)
- Calculated fields (total_amount = base_amount + tax)

Security & Performance:
- JWT token authentication for all endpoints
- User isolation (users only see their own expenses)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Optimized database queries
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

Implementation Requirements:
- Next.js API routes with TypeScript support
- Prisma ORM integration
- Helper functions for token verification
- Comprehensive error handling
- Response pagination metadata

Provide complete API implementations for /api/expenses and /api/expenses/[id] routes.
```

### **Changes Produced**:
- âœ… **Advanced Filtering**: Multiple filter combinations with search functionality
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Efficient Prisma queries with proper indexing usage
- âœ… **Pagination System**: Complete pagination with metadata (total count, pages, etc.)
- âœ… **Security Enhancement**: Robust token verification and user isolation
- âœ… **Calculated Fields**: Automatic total amount calculation in responses

### **Why This Prompt Worked**:
The prompt specified both basic requirements and advanced features, allowing Gemini to create APIs that would scale with the application. The emphasis on security and performance guided the implementation quality.
