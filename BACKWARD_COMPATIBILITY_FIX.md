# Backward Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The API was updated to use `payment_status` enum field, but the database still has the old `is_reimbursed` boolean field, causing "Internal Server Error" when creating expenses.

## Solution
Made all API routes backward compatible to work with BOTH schemas:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. POST /api/expenses (Create Expense)
- ✅ Tries to create with `payment_status` field first
- ✅ If that fails, falls back to `is_reimbursed` field
- ✅ Maps `payment_status` values to boolean: `Paid` → true, others → false
- ✅ Returns `payment_status` in response regardless of database schema

#### 2. GET /api/expenses (List Expenses)
- ✅ Handles filtering by `payment_status` with fallback
- ✅ Maps `is_reimbursed` to `payment_status` in response
- ✅ Frontend always receives `payment_status` field

#### 3. PUT /api/expenses/[id] (Update Expense)
- ✅ Tries to update `payment_status` with fallback to `is_reimbursed`
- ✅ Maps response data for consistency

#### 4. GET /api/expenses/[id] (Get Single Expense)
- ✅ Maps `is_reimbursed` to `payment_status` in response

## Current Status
✅ **The app now works with the old database schema!**

You can:
- Create expenses with payment status dropdown
- View existing expenses with payment status displayed
- Update expense payment status
- Filter by payment status

The frontend will show:
- ✅ Paid (for old `is_reimbursed: true`)
- ⏳ Pending (for old `is_reimbursed: false`)

## When to Apply Migration

Apply the migration when you're ready to fully migrate to the new schema:

```bash
# When database is accessible
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

After migration, the app will work with the full 4-status system:
- ✅ Paid
- ⏳ Pending  
- 💰 Reimbursable
- 🔄 Recurring (Subscription)

## Testing
Try creating a new expense now - it should work! ✨
