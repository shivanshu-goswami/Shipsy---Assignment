# Netlify Build Fix - TypeScript Linting Errors

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was failing due to TypeScript linting errors in Prisma generated files, specifically:

1. **`require()` style imports forbidden**: Generated Prisma files used CommonJS `require()` statements instead of ES6 imports
2. **Unexpected `any` types**: Generated files contained `any` types that violated TypeScript linting rules
3. **Empty object types**: Generated files used `{}` types that triggered linting warnings
4. **Various other TypeScript linting rule violations**

## Root Cause
The project was applying strict TypeScript ESLint rules to automatically generated Prisma client files in `app/generated/prisma/`. These files are generated by Prisma and should not be manually edited or subjected to linting rules.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated ESLint Configuration (`eslint.config.mjs`)
```javascript
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"),
  {
    ignores: [
      "node_modules/**",
      ".next/**",
      "out/**",
      "build/**",
      "next-env.d.ts",
      "app/generated/**",      // Added: Exclude Prisma generated files
      "prisma/generated/**",   // Added: Exclude any other Prisma generated files
    ],
  },
];
```

### 2. Created `.eslintignore` File
Added an ESLint ignore file as an additional safeguard:
```
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Next.js build output
.next/
out/
build/

# Generated files
app/generated/
prisma/generated/

# Environment files
next-env.d.ts

# Prisma client files (if generated elsewhere)
**/prisma/client/
```

### 3. Updated `next.config.js`
Added webpack configuration to prevent scanning issues:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    config.watchOptions = {
      ...config.watchOptions,
      ignored: [
        '**/node_modules/**',
        '**/.next/**',
        '**/Application Data/**',
        'C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Application Data\\**',
      ],
    };
    return config;
  },
  experimental: {
    esmExternals: 'loose',
  },
};
```

## Verification
- ✅ `npx next lint` now passes with no errors or warnings
- ✅ ESLint correctly ignores generated Prisma files
- ✅ All project source code still passes linting rules

## Expected Result
The Netlify build should now succeed because:
1. Generated Prisma files are excluded from linting
2. Only manually written code is subject to TypeScript linting rules
3. The build process no longer fails on auto-generated code violations

## Files Modified
- `eslint.config.mjs` - Updated ignore patterns
- `.eslintignore` - Created new file
- `next.config.js` - Updated webpack configuration

## Next Steps
1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Trigger a new Netlify deployment
3. The build should now complete successfully without TypeScript linting errors
